# Read-ASE
This file takes an ASE file of a 3D model and creates a corresponding header file which contins the model's vertex information.
It can be compiled by version earlier than C++11.

Vertices[] contains the vertex coordinate.
Normals[] contains the vertex normal vector.
UV[] contains the vertex's texture coordinate.
Elements[] contains the three vertex index that forms a triangle.
